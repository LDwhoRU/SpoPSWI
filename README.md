spotifyPlaylistScraper
==================================

spotifyPlaylistScraper is a semi-automated tool designed for linux and MacOS that allows users to populate a spotify playlist at
regular intervals. The script will fetch the entire discography of artists you follow and filter the returned results to only include
releases from a predefined period of time. Our handy flask companion tool can be used to manage the script, sign in to your spotify
account, and generate the playlist.
